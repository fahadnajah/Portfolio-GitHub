            During my time off from school work, I always watched any content relating to vehicles, I found them very entertaining. Additionally, I enjoyed sketching cars and daydreaming about the future of this industry and how advanced vehicles will become. Moreover, I started practising my skills in coding and did a few projects to improve them. I watched many tutorials on YouTube and took a few courses on SoloLearn, a platform many use to start or improve their skills in coding. I also attended the Nestle x L'Oréal Event to enhance my professional skills. Outside of my academics, I like to stay active. I specifically like running, so I have participated in many 200m races at my school and won medals and certificates for winning the races.<br />

            <p class="des">Introducing an extraordinary concept car that merges cutting-edge maglev technology with advanced features. This innovative vehicle utilizes high-performance Samarium cobalt magnets for their temperature resistance and stability, allowing for a frictionless and efficient ride. The maglev technology works by generating a powerful magnetic field that interacts with specially designed roadways, enabling the car to hover and glide smoothly above the surface. Equipped with self-driving capabilities, AI-powered systems, and a suite of sensors, this concept car offers a safer and more intuitive driving experience. The interior boasts a futuristic design, featuring luxurious materials and a sleek steering wheel. With zero emissions and regenerative braking, this concept car represents the future of sustainable and exhilarating transportation, showcasing the potential of advanced technology in the automotive industry. Challenges were not absent in this project. To design the car, I had to learn much about the technology used to make such a car possible. I aimed to create a futuristic car that seamlessly blends cutting-edge features with familiar elements.</p>

                    This project focuses on designing a futuristic sustainable bus. This innovative vehicle integrates a solar panel on its roof, harnessing solar energy to power its operations. To ensure uninterrupted functionality, even on cloudy days, the bus is equipped with a backup charging system. The bus is designed to be driverless, with a spacious interior featuring comfortable seating for passengers. This project embodies my commitment to environmentally friendly transportation solutions and showcases my vision for a sustainable future in the automotive industry.

            <p class="des">A sustainable bus designed for the future of public transportation. This driverless bus features a sleek design with a dark grey solar panel on the top, strategically chosen to absorb ample sunlight for sustainable energy generation. Its spacious interior provides abundant seating capacity, and each seat is equipped with a unique storage system. By opening upwards, the seats offer convenient storage compartments for passengers to safely store their belongings during the ride. The bus is covered in glass, creating a futuristic design while allowing for panoramic views of the surroundings. With cutting-edge technology and luxurious seating featuring two armrests per chair, this sustainable bus offers a comfortable and sophisticated travel experience. It represents a leap forward in eco-friendly transportation, combining innovative design, convenience, and sustainability for the passengers of tomorrow. I did encounter a few problems with the storage space and the seating plan but I managed to overcome them by using my problem-solving and creative skills.</p>

                    Another project I have undertaken centres around a futuristic and technologically advanced car. This remarkable vehicle is equipped with Smart Glass technology throughout, including the roof and windows. The Smart Glass allows for seamless control over the opacity and view of the outside from the car’s interior. Whether you desire a panoramic view of the surroundings, a more private setting, or even the ability to gaze upon the wonders of the galaxy from inside the car, this car offers unparalleled flexibility. With the touch of a button, passengers can transform the ambience and create a personalised environment. This project showcases my dedication to incorporating cutting-edge technology into automotive design, reimagining the driving experience for the future.
